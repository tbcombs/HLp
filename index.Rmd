Welcome to summer fun!

To help us prepare for PS 6403 (or purely for fun), I will post a few different exercises throughout the summer to provide some practice in R and a review of regression analysis.

Exercise 1 looks at inequality and income in STL neighborhoods and models the relationship with bivariate regression. Enjoy!
