## Introduction

Since universal Newborn Hearing Screening (NBHS) was mandated two decades ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has collected data from each State’s NBHS program [annual report](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/ehdi-data.html). The annual report includes many metrics involving screening, diagnosis, and early intervention of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHOH) newborn babies.  While the amount of data is impressive, the ability to determine relative or absolute progress by state or nationally is not easy.  Hearing Loss prevalence (HLp), arguably one of the most significant of these metrics, was chosen to facilitate comparisons between states.

In this presentation, HLp data for the period 2007-2019 are presented in several interactive formats making it easier to learn the relative or absolute progress any state made in this period.  It also illustrates the overall national progress the NBHS program has made since 2007.

HLp was chosen because it is arguably the most meaningful early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) metric; Early Intervention cannot commence until DHOH babies are found. It is also the quotient of two highly reliable metrics, the CDC defined “Hearing Loss” and “Total Screened,” the former because it is the result of audiological/medical diagnoses, and the latter because most states successfully screen a very high percentage of its newborn babies.

Some may find HLp unfamiliar because, compared to other metrics such as “Loss to Follow-Up” or “Total Screened,” it is not commonly emphasized in EHDI reports and communications. With Hearing Loss being normalized to Total Screened, HLp as a metric allows a population independent comparison over time within a state, between states, and  the United States as a whole.  Clearly visible is the overall increase in HLp the US has made over this period, although there are suggestions of a slowing trend 2018-9.  For many states, these data may be a source of pride and satisfaction about the progress of their programs. For others, it may well be a source of concern.

## States above and below 2019 median HLp value by year, 2007-2019

Figure 1 displays the numbers of states above and below the 2019 median HLp value of 1.79.  Apparent is the overall positive impact on US HLp of the EHDI program over this period.  Many states significantly improved their individual HLp. Mouse over the bars to see the percentage of states reporting above or below the 2019 median each year.

## Smoothed line plots

Figure 2 shows the actual reported prevalence by state (pink lines) and smoothed trend lines (green) to discard small year-to-year variations. States are ordered from top to bottom by their latest HLp values. The black dots represent the US median in 2019 for comparison. Remove either type of line from all states in the figure by clicking on the legend (bottom right).

## Comparison line plots

Figure 3 shows the reported prevalences by state and for the US overall along with annual mean and median. Hover over a point to get state, year, HLp value, and quartile (Highest, Moderately High, Moderately Low, Lowest). Click on a line or point to isolate it, or choose one or more lines to compare from the dropdown menu. Double-click in the whitespace to bring all the lines back. To zoom in after selecting states for comparison, drag and drop the mouse from left to right over the plot area. If applicable, the range of the axes will change to fit the selection. 

Notes:

- It may take a little practice on a touch device to master all the features.

- Line color in figure 3 is only to make visualization easier.

## Heatmap

In Figure 4 states are ranked and color coded in 4 fixed HLp ranges.  These ranges are determined by 2019 quartiles.  In this way, it is possible to see how the distribution of states (in the fixed intervals defined in the key) has changed over time. States are ordered from highest (top) to lowest (bottom) average HLp (top to bottom). Mouse over any box for more information. Click on a state or states to isolate all years for the selection.

Note: 

- The figure shows how states having HLp > 1.79 steadily increase in number 2007-2017, while showing a curious reversal of this trend 2018-9.
