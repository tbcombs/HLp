### Welcome to summer fun!

<br><br>

To help us prepare for PS 6403 (or purely for fun), I will post a few different exercises throughout the summer to provide some practice in R and a review of regression analysis. Approximately two weeks after each exercise is posted, I will post an answer key. Remember that there are officially a thousand ways to do each thing in R, so if your results match mine and your code is clean and annotated everything should be good. 

Since this is not for class, I cannot commit to answering every question you may have or to inspect your 700 lines of code for errors and incorrect coding (not that this wasn't fun during the semester). 

Accordingly, please use the comments box for questions, and help me out by replying to others' comments if you can help. Check the *email me replies* box to get notifications when someone answers. I will check the comments intermittently as time allows.

Enjoy!
