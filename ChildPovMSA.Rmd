# Child poverty in US Metropolitan Statistical Areas

## Introduction

<font size="5">
You work for a non-profit that is partnering with the government to combat child poverty in urban areas. You are tasked with identifying metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that are most at risk for high rates of child poverty. You decide to perform an OLS regression to determine the characteristics of large urban areas that are most correlated with child poverty. 

You have a dataset containing a sample of 300 MSAs. Read the data into R from this url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbcombs/RnR/master/MSA2016.csv. You will also find variable definitions online here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbcombs/RnR/master/MSA2016_dataDefs.txt.

You hypothesize that unemployment, income, and inequality are driving factors of child poverty, or that at least that each is  highly correlated with child poverty. You also want to test for a relationship between child poverty and racial diversity in MSAs, and to control for average household size, since as household size increases, it is logical to believe that there are more children. 
Finally, you suspect that large MSAs - those with one million or more people, are qualitatively different from smaller metro areas, and in addition, you believe that large MSAs that are relatively wealthy might be more likely to have social safety net programs in place and therefore lower rates of child poverty. You will model this relationship by including an interaction term in the model between income and the dichotomous variable for large MSAs.

## Step 1: Read in data & formulate hypotheses

Read in the data, review the data definitions, and formally state your hypothesis.

Read the data into R. Load only the libraries that you need.




```{r libsData}

#libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(lmtest)
library(stargazer)
library(car)
library(sandwich)
#graph theme
theme_set(theme_minimal())


#data
r <- read_csv("R11712137_SL140.csv")


```

## Step 2: Visualization of variables and relationships.

Create appropriate plots to 1) visualize the distribution of the dependent variable, 2) visualize each of the independent variables with the dependent variable, and 3) visualize the interaction between MSA size and income and its relationship with child poverty. Interpret the plots. Are the distributions approximately normal? What is the relationship? Is it linear? What else can you say about each plot?

```{r dataManip}

#keep only needed vars
r <- r %>%
  select(Geo_FIPS,Geo_TRACT,Geo_COUNTY,SE_T057_001,SE_T157_001)

#rename vars & recode income into 10,000s
r <- r %>%
  mutate(mhhi10k = SE_T057_001/10000) %>%
  rename(gini = SE_T157_001)



```



```{r vizVars, fig.cap="Distributions of Gini index and median household income, St. Louis City & County census tracts, 2016"}

r2 <- r %>%
  select(gini,mhhi10k) %>%
  rename(`Gini index of inequality` = gini,
         `Median household income ($10,000s)` = mhhi10k) %>%
  gather(key,val)

h <- r2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(val))

h <- h + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~key, scales="free_x") 

h <- h + labs(x="",y="Number of census tracts")

h

```

```{r vizRelation, fig.cap="Gini index and income, St. Louis City & County census tracts, 2016"}




#visualize relationship
g <- r %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mhhi10k,y=gini))

g <- g + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

g <- g + labs(x="Median household income ($10,000s)",
              y = "Gini index of inequality")

g

```

## Step 3: Multivariate OLS model

Model child poverty (Y) on the predictors, including the interaction. Do not forget to include the categorical variable as a factor. Discuss the GOF for the model. How is the fit?

```{r mods}

#model level-level
m1 <- lm(gini~mhhi10k,r)

#model level-log
m2 <- lm(gini~log(SE_T057_001),r)

#model level-quadratic
m3 <- lm(gini~mhhi10k + I(mhhi10k^2),r)

```

## Step 5: Model diagnostics

Check the model for multicollinearity. Remember that the interaction term directly builds in multicollinearity, since two variables are represented twice. Are there other concerns about multicollinearity?

Check the model for heteroskedasticity visually and with a test statistic. Interpret the plot. Should you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis of the Breush Pagan test? 

```{r diags1, fig.cap="Residuals vs. fitted plot"}

# check for heteroskedasticity
bptest(m3)

# get residuals and fitted values with SEs
r <- r %>%
  mutate(res = as.numeric(resid(m3)),
         fit = as.numeric(predict(m3)),
         seFit = as.numeric(predict(m3,se=T)[[2]]))

# residuals vs fitted plot
rvf <- r %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=fit,y=res))

rvf <- rvf + geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,color="red",linetype=2)

rvf <- rvf + labs(x="Fitted values",
                  y="Residuals")
rvf
```

Check that the continous predictors are linear with the model predictions through visualization. Do the relationships seem sufficiently linear?

```{r diags2, fig.cap="Check for linearity of predictions"}
# check for linearity
lc <- r %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mhhi10k,y=fit))

# wait, it is not a linear model but a quadratic one!
lc <- lc + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm",
                                      formula = y ~ x + I(x^2))
lc <- lc + labs(x="Median household income ($10,000s)",
                y="Predicted Gini index")

lc

```

Check for influential observations. If necessary, re-run the model without potential offending observations and compare coefficient estimates. Should you keep the whole sample or discard some influential observations? 


## Step 6: Model results

Present the model results in a table or graph and confirm whether you have retained the entire sample. Interpret everything you should interpret. Should you accept your alternative hypotheses or reject them?

```{r modResults}

stargazer(m3)

```

## Step 7: Visualize predictions

Create some graphs to visualize the predicted rates of child poverty across representative values (or the ranges) of the predictors. Create at least one graph depicting how the interaction affects predictions. Also, two coefficients are directly comparable. Which are they, and how do they compare substantively?

```{r preds, fig.cap="Inequality in St. Louis neighborhoods as predicted by income"}

# plot predictions
mypr <- r %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mhhi10k,y=fit,ymin=fit-1.96*seFit,
             ymax=fit+1.96*seFit))

mypr <- mypr + geom_errorbar() + geom_point()

mypr <- mypr + labs(x="Median household income ($10,000s)",
                    y="Predicted Gini index with 95% confidence intervals")

mypr



```


## Step 8: Discussion

What are your recommendations for choosing MSAs in which to implement the anti-child poverty program? Which characteristics do you think are most important?
